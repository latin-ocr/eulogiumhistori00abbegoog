Cotton. Domitian. A. Χ., Harl. 200, eto.) is sufficient to
establish the fact that our author either used the latter
Ohroniole or had aceess to the sources from which it '
vas compiled.

The Historia of Geoffrey having been already
’ several times printed, it would bc superfluous to
exhihit the differences between its text and that of
the Eulogium vvith the same degree of minuteness as
in the case of an unpuhlished MS„ such as that oi ¹
the Geographia Universalis, or the MS, Harl. 655 oi
the Polichronioon; it will he sufficient to give a
summary of the more important deviatious hom the
Historia, with references to the corresponding pas·
- sagos of La3amon and the French Brut. It vvill he.
remarkerl by those who give themselves the trouble
of collation‚ that the portion of Geoffrey’s work
, which commences vvith the life of lilerlim anri termi-
nates with the death of king Arthur, has been
transcribed with extreme oloseness‚ especially in the
Mss B. and D„ the original of which appears to
have been carefully collated vvith the text of the
Historia, as the list of various readings vvill show.
From the account of the death of Ashur, to the oon-
clusion of the Historia, the modification of Geoffrey’s
, text in the Eulogium shows few signs of¹ reference to
any source hut the Historia Britonum.
