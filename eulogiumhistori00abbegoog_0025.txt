XX PREFAOE.

e had amitten these two passages after having heard of the

,⁰0 5⁴, translation 01 Barnet, who was postulated to Ely hya
' Papal Bull, dated ldth December, ΑΒ. 1301110 tem-
poralities being restored to him alth April, AD. 1367,

it is extremely improbable that he would havc pre·

sarred chronioling the mere popular talk of the likeli-

’ ’11001 or desirablencss of the translation to stating the
fact of the translation itself3· it would be a very
minute Chronicler indeed who, writing sometime after
the events, would include in the history of a period
the mere report of the probability of an episcopal pro·
motion, which afterwards actually took place, for its
own sake only, and accordingly in no other chroniclc
of tho period which mentions the translation is the
report in question noticed. It is therefore all but
ocrtain that these last entries were written before our
author had heard 01 the electior of Barnet, that is,
wa may fairly assume, before the middle of the year 3
1367, on the most disadvantageous oomputation. There ,
is only one fact which appears to weigh against this
conclusion, and that is that just after the notice of ³

the election of Wykeham an account of his consecration
is promised in a future page (“ quomodo consecratus l
“imposterum plenius explicetur ¹¹), as if the author had
been aware that-it had already taken place. Now as ς
this consecration was not celebrated until loth October, =
ΑΒ. 13117, 11 seems morally certain that if he had heard
of it he must also have heard of the election of Barnet.
11 is far more likely that when the account of the
consecratiou was promised, our author, with many
others, expected that it would follow the electiori very
closely, according to custom, and made no allowance
for the unusual delay in this instance of the Papa]
confirmation.
