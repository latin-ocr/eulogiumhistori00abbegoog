the duhcdom of Norrnandy on the death cf his father,
all probably condensed from the chronicis of William
of Jumieges.

The largcr portion of cap. ccxxxvrr. is occupied by
a narrative, at first very brief, afterwards more de*

tailed, of the events of English history, irorn the ,

marriage oi Aethelred H. and Emma to the death of

William the Conquerar. There are many peculiarities Ἴ ’

in the representations of facts existing in the earlier
part of this narrative, which, combined with occasional
verbal coincidences, would seem to show that cur
author either here actually copied the Historia Anglo·
rum of Henry of Huntingdon, or used the same

authorities as that chronicler, with tha addition of . Ι

matter from other sources, or at least employed sorno
later authority in which the facts peculiar to Hunt-
ingdon and the additional matter had been already
combined in the form in urlrich they appear in the
Eulogium. With Huntingdon he represents Aelfrcd,

the son oi Aethelred and Emma, as having been sent
ior into Narmandy by the English nobles immediately ,s

after the death of Harthaenut, the anglo-Saron ’
chronicis and Florence of Worcester assigning his

arrival and martyrdom to nl). 1036, during the life

of Harcld Harefoot. With Huntingdou again our author ⁵

asserta that Edward, the brother of Aelfrcd, on his

brother's death, was summoned from Normandy3 i

whereas, according to the Saxon chromate, he had
arrived in England in AD. 1041, before the death of
his predecessor. ⁹

After the account oi the marriage of, Edward our s

author appears to have gone to. a new authority, for

the account of the events subsequent to that union is ,

much more fully given than in the chronicis of

Huntingdon, and approachas sometimes very closely to ἶ
the account in the Gesta of Wiliiam of Malmesbury, .

mors often to that given in the Historia Major of Ἴ
