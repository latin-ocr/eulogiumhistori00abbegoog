Eulogium, astho GeographiaUniversalis appears to have
been copied for thaprecediug portion of the Fourth Book.
The two latter chapters, cap. oux, andcnx1.‚ooinoide
much more closely with the account of Hibernia in
the Polichronioon‚ as represented by the text of MS.
Harl. N o. suspergressus there are slight addi-
tions, giving greater detail and circumstantiality iu a
few particulam, to the descriptions of Higden. The
arrangement of' the chapters in the Policbrouioon is
somewhat disturbed‚ however, for after commencing
with the account of the first inhabitants in cap. curn,
aud following Higden's order in cap. OLX. and the

first half of cap. ccxc, our author, mentioning him as · ³

“the monk of Obester‚’' goes back to his discussion
on S. Patrick's staff and the snakes in a preceding

chapter of the Policbronicon. He then extracls nearly Ι, i

the whole of the chapter again preceding that, quotes
s the remarks of Higden‚ again referring to him, upon
the account of Chester by Williamof Malmesbury in
another part of the same book, and finally extraots a
portion of a chapter upon Ireland‚ which precedes all
the others which he has hitherto quoted. lt may
perhaps be supposed that the contradictions of the

“monk of Ohcster,” which are tc bc found in this Ἴ ,

part of the Eulogium, would hardly have been made if
our author had been copying him so freely and so
recently as has been asserted, and it certainly does
seem to need some explanation. But I see no escape
from the conclusion that it is Higden and uo other
person who has been used aud vilified. lf the ac-
count of Hibernia in the Policbronicon had been taken
from one source only, the supposition that both
authors had used that source independently might
bave been teuable3 but, it is not only Giraldus but
Solinus and Bada, who contribule to Higden’s account,
and the order iu wlrich the extracts are arranged is
the sarus iu that work aud iu the Eulogium. Basides
