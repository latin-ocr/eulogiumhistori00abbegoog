Edward the Third. Oompared with the preceding =
portion of the work, this book is of great velue, both
as containing an independent contemporary account of
the events of the later part oi the reign of Edward,
and as affording evidence of the carefulness and
accuracy of the author in the character cf an annalist.

The book commences with a brief original intro-
duction, describing the subjects to 'be considered, and
after giving notices of the first colonisers of Italy,
from Solinus and Dares Phrygius and the genealogies ,
cf AEneas and Priam, follows the fortunas of the „
Greek generals who survived the Trojan war. In ’
cap. ΙΙ. we commones the history of Brute and
his successore, which is continued through several
chapters down to the end of the present volume. It t
is founded, like all similar narratives, upon the ¹
Historia Regum Britonum of Geoffrey of Monmcuth, ,
with which it frequently coincides almost verbally

Ἴ for many long passages, the minute deviations arising ¹
· sometimes from additions, more often from omissions,

very rarely indeed from transposition. The character l
oi these variations, especially of the additions, ig

such as to show that besides the work of Geoffrey =

other *sources must have been simtdtaneously em·

and the French Prose Brut (MSS. Beg. 20. A. ΙΙΙ, ’

ferent forms of the same proper amplas of this are the use of “de
