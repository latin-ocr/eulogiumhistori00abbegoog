chapter headed “De sanctorum” (sc. Hiberniae) “prae-
“ ooniis‚” is almost entirely extracted1

ln cap. cunin. the very remarkable rhyming desorip
tion of Wallia in the Polichronicon is transcribed
entire, save a few omissione which sometimes injure
the sense. It ie not referred by Higden in the form
in wlnch it is presented in his Chroniole to any earlier
authority, though of course many of the facts which
are mentioned init must have been taken by bino
from antecedent sources It is prohable‚ therefore,
. that the composition oi the verses, such as they are,

is entirely due to Higden and not to apredeoessor‚
and therefore that our author obtained thern from the

Poliohronieon and not from any other work to which
both he and Higden had independent access.2
