immacu. XXV

a Geographical Dictionary, conrpiled from various
· sources; and it is very probablo, ¹on grounds which will
bo developed as we proceed, that a large portion os the
Fourth Book of the EulOgium has been copied from it or
some similar work. Reference to it will render intel-
ligible many passages in our text, which tlre ornissions
committed by our author in transcribing from it, or from
some work closely resembling it, for there are visible
here and there indications of an independent source, have
rendered unconstruable. lt has been as badly abbre-
viated as the Polichrouicon for the First Book, and the
same species of errors have been committed in both cases.
¹The next chapter of the Eulogium is almost entirely
taken from this Dietionary3 for though the quota·
tion from Isidorus, with which it connnences, hascer-
tainly been transcribed from the Etymologiae, and not
from K.² yet as the different authorities subsequently
quoted are the same, and follow one another io ex·
actly the same order in both K. and the Eulogium,
and as moreover the increments of the text of K. on
that ‘of the Eulogium supply omissions in the latter
which spoil the sense, it is more than probable that
the text of K. represents the source from which our
author obtained the larger portion of his materials for
cap. xi. Higdsn quotes only s portion of the authorities

with K. will prove this assertion. “ quod eas intersecat ;” in hdo-23,
