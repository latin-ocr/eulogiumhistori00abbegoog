Gaetulia, is altogether 11010 1110110001001110.1 The ac-
count 01 Byzacena is entirely from Isidorus, The
account 01 Zeugia (or Zeugitana, or Zeugis) is also
fromlsidorus‚ who is copied so faithfully that his short
note on Gaetulia, which follows the description 01
Zeugis, is set 'down as part 01 11, notwithstanding
the existence 01 the description 01 Gaetulia already
given 10 000. 111111. The last sentence 011110 chapter
is 110111 1110 account 01 Zeugis in the Geographia‚
and the words “et elephantis et pardis'' 11010 00100

in the words 01 the Geographia, which end with tho
first line 3 that which follows, is 11010 Isidorus with 0
few unimportant omissions and uariations.2 The account
01 11000100103 commences with a quotation from Isi-
dorus also in the Geographia; butas the latter is not
so faithfully copied 11010 the Etymologiae as our text, it
10 001 difficult to decide which 01 the two our author
has used. As soon 00 the extract from Isidorus termi-
nates, the Geographia‚ however, is certainly taken up,
the remainder 01 the chapter being a copy 01 the
paraphrase 10 that work 01 Pliny’s account 01 Mauri-
tania in his Hist. Nat. lib. 1. The mistakes in the
Geographia 010 here faithfully reproduced.4 The ao-
