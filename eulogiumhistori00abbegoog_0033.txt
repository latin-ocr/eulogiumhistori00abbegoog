In cair. XVI. Isidorus is the sole source ;1 ihc omis·
sion oi Media and Persia leads in cap. XVII. to Meso- s
potamia3 to the account of which in Isidorus a brief ’
supplement fr'om the Geographia is added.2 The account
of 'Babylonia in cap. XVIII. is undoubtedly copied 3
from the (ieographia. This is clear, as well from the ³
arrangement and phraseology being ideniical in both,
as hom ihc facis, among others, that the quotation

on Isaiali ΧΠΙ. and XIV„ and that ihc reader is j

of the Geographia which are inapplicahle here, as
the account of Chaldaea follows immediately, while in
the Geographia it· is, oi course, separated from that
of Babylonia by uiany peges.3 This labier account, in Ἴ
