ΤΗΕ authorities employed in the compilation of
'the additions in the complete Octton MS. need only
be indicated, as the writers cf them have in general

given references to the works which they have used, ¹

and the extracts have been almost always carefully

‚ made. The chief sources cf the notes printed in tho

text of the present volume are the Historia 100010- ¹
siastica of Beda and the (testa Regum Anglo'rum cf
'William of Mahnesbury.

The latter work alone has supplied the account of
the kings of Essex in pp. 158, 9, cf Wessex in pp.
1601, and Nerthumhria in pp. 167, 8, while both
have contributed to those of the kings cf East Anglia
in pp. 159, 160, of Mercia in pp. 162-5, andos Kent
in pp. sor-9. The account of the first colonication
of Albion in pp. 216-8 is found in the introduction of
many of the Brute Ohro'nicles The addition in p. 202
is from¹ Gecffrey· That in p. 257 apparently from
Martinus Polonus. That in pp. 265, 6 is professedly
taken from a Brute Chronicla as also are those in
pp. 302, 7, 66, and perhaps those in pp. 270, 80, 302,
and 319, 20. Το0 majority of the additions in the
Third Volume have been taken from Petrus Ficariensis,
of whom some account will be given in the Prefaoe, in
which the sources of the remaining portion of the
Eulogium itself will be considered.

In explanation of the minuteness with which the
variatione between the text cf our author and the
sources presumably employed by him have been given
in the 'notes to the fcregoing peges, it may be stated
that the whole of the text of the Second and Third
Volumes had been sent tc press before the Editor
