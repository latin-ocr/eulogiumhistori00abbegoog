these suspicions facts, there is another curicus circurn-
stauce to be noted, and that is that not only are the
authorities followed by Higden copied to the same
extent and in the same order as iu the Polichronicon,
hut original remarks upon these authorities, though
apparently opposed to the opinions of our author, are
actually transcribed. Thus, Higden in his chapter “In
“ quihus rebus sufficit,'' says, of course on his own
authority: “Et quamvis Beda dicit hanc terram vineis
“ non expertem, et Solinus 'et Isidorus apibus eam
“ carere asserunt, circumspectius tamone diverso scrip-
* “sissent si earn uineis carere et apum expertem non
“ fuisse (esse. al.) dixissent.” These words cur author,
who only a few lines above has taken Higden to task
for underrating the assertione of Beda, J erome, aad
Isidorus, actually transcribas alrnost exactly, only
accidentally omitting “fixisse'' It is very prohahle‚
however, that some of these inconsistencies may he

due to imperfect correction, of which the MS. A. here
