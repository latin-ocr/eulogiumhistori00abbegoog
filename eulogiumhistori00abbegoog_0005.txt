The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editore, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury. 0

The Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, after a careful

consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion ina
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan ἕ

recommended by the Master of the Rolls “vvas well

calculated for the accomplishment of this important Ι
national object, inan effectual and sat ttisfac tory manner, ‘·

within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be s
paid to economy, in making the det ailed arrangenrents, ’
wrt 'thout unuecessary expense? ᾗ

They expressedt their approbat ron of the proposalt that „

each chronicle and hist orical document should be edit ed

in such a manner as to representwr with all possible correct ·
uess the text of each writer, derived from acollation of the

best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except ’
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They ,
suggested, however, that the prefaoe to each work should , “
contain, iu addition to the particulars proposed by the ’
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author, ⁹

so far as authentic materiale existed for ‘that purpose, and
an estimate of his historical credibility and value.
