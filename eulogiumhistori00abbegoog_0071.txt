is mentioued and lhe Legend of ihc Purgation of
Queen Emma¹ indroduoed, which forms lhe subjeci
of cap. 0111111111. The source of hhis legend is cer-
'cainly nol 1110 Ρο11011101110011, the acconnl ihere given
(lib. vr. cap. 23) being less circumstaniial chan chal
in. ihe Eulogium, and differing in some particulare
common 10 110111. The accounts in Bromplon and
Knighlon are verbally lhe same as. Higden's„ Our
aulhor’s version of this legend more nearly resembles
111111 given by Polydore Vergil, as quoted in dhe Acca
Sanctorum. The legend is undoubtedly 01 modern
origin, as ic does 1101 appear in any of Jche earlier
lives 01 1110 Confessor. The dahc which is given al
ohe end of p. 186, professedly from ohe Hisloriae
Britonunq differs in exoess from 11101 assigned 101110
eveno hy Higden by three years.

Following ihis we have an accounl 01 S. hrodulfus,

here called Arnulfivs, which may possibly have heen
taken from ihc Polichronicon, where 11 is given under
AD. 698, and is quoted from lhe Historia Ecclesias-
lica of Beda (lib. v. cap. 15, ed. Slevenson p. 372).
