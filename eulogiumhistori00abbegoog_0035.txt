XXX PREFAGE.

Galilaea, in caps. xxiv. and xxv„ are copied from the ι
Geographia, which adds to the descripticns of Isidorus
a supplement from other sources.l The account of
Cedat, in cap. xxva, is entirely from the same source.2
’ ,The account of Egypt, in cap. xxvia, is also copied
from the Geographia,⁸ the extracis from Isidorus with
which it commences coinciding on the whole more
closely with the text of K. than ,with that oi the
Etymologiae. As a proof cf the closeness with which
the Geographia is followed, we may instance the
repetition in our text of the unnecessary sepa
ration in that MS. of a continuans passage oi

Isidorus into two, a reference to Isidorus being ap·

pended to the e‘nd oi each, and the faithful preser-
vation of a wrong quotation from Orosius, which is
speeified in the note.⁴² The Etymologiae is again re·
